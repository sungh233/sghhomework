1）&emsp;In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. 

2）&emsp;The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number.

3）&emsp;In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

4）&emsp;In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.
